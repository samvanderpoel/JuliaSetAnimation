# Julia Set Animation
Generates images of Julia sets and creates video animation of Julia set sequence. \
See the resulting [animation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xrxp-0CHZGM). \
I used [this](https://scipython.com/book/chapter-7-matplotlib/problems/p72/the-julia-set) resource for code to generate individual Julia set images.
